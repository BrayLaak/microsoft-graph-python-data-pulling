# microsoft-graph-python-data-pulling
 Using Python to pull data from Microsoft Office environments using Microsoft Graph API

 This project will focus on pulling Azure Active Directory user data by interfacing with a sandbox Office environment made generated with Microsoft's developer program. It will then clean and filter relevant data, and present it using Matplotlib or Seaborn

 This project is a starting point that I will be able to alter in the future to pull multiple types of data from different Microsft Office environments using the Graph API

To start it will:

Use an API to pull in data
Use built-in pandas or numpy functions to clean the data
Use custom functions to operate on the data
Make 2 basic plots with matplotlib or seaborn to visualize the requested data
